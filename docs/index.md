## Introduction

Welcome to **AIAgents4Pharma** â€“ an open-source project by [Team VPE](https://github.com/VirtualPatientEngine) that brings together AI-driven tools to help researchers and pharma interact seamlessly with complex biological data.

Our toolkit currently consists of the following agents:

- **Talk2BioModels** _(v1 released; v2 in progress)_: Engage directly with mathematical models in systems biology.
- **Talk2KnowledgeGraphs** _(v1 in progress)_: Access and explore complex biological knowledge graphs for insightful data connections.
- **Talk2Scholars** _(v1 in progress)_: Get recommendations for articles related to your choice. Download, query, and write/retrieve them to your reference manager (currently supporting Zotero).
- **Talk2Cells** _(v1 in progress)_: Query and analyze sequencing data with ease.

## Getting Started

![Python Version from PEP 621 TOML](https://img.shields.io/python/required-version-toml?tomlFilePath=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FVirtualPatientEngine%2FAIAgents4Pharma%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmain%2Fpyproject.toml)

### Installation

#### Option 1: PyPI

```bash
pip install aiagents4pharma
```

Check out the tutorials on each agent for detailed instrcutions.

#### Option 2: docker hub

_Please note that this option is currently available only for Talk2Biomodels._

1. **Pull the image**
   ```
   docker pull virtualpatientengine/talk2biomodels
   ```
2. **Run a container**
   ```
   docker run -e OPENAI_API_KEY=<openai_api_key> -e NVIDIA_API_KEY=<nvidia_api_key> -p 8501:8501 virtualpatientengine/talk2biomodels
   ```
_You can create a free account at NVIDIA and apply for their
free credits [here](https://build.nvidia.com/explore/discover)._

#### Option 3: git

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VirtualPatientEngine/AIAgents4Pharma
   cd AIAgents4Pharma
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```
3. **Initialize OPENAI_API_KEY and NVIDIA_API_KEY**
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=....
   ```
   ```bash
   export NVIDIA_API_KEY=....
   ```
_You can create a free account at NVIDIA and apply for their
free credits [here](https://build.nvidia.com/explore/discover)._

4. **[Optional] Initialize LANGSMITH_API_KEY**
   ```bash
   export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
   export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
   ```
_Please note that this will create a new tracing project in your Langsmith
account with the name `T2X-xxxx`, where `X` can be `B` (Biomodels), `S` (Scholars),
`KG` (KnowledgeGraphs), or `C` (Cells). If you skip the previous step, it will
default to the name `default`. `xxxx` will be the 4-digit ID created for the
session._

5. **Launch the app:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app/frontend/streamlit_app_<agent>.py
   ```
_Replace <agent> with the agent name you are interested to launch._

For detailed instructions on each agent, please refer to their respective modules.
